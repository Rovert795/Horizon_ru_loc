The depiction of Rachel's\nstruggles and frustrations as she works toward her goal of\nforming a cheerleading squad—and the sense of\naccomplishment that comes upon her success—has\nresonated with the hearts of teenagers over the years. This\nfilm has inspired many young folk to take up cheerleading\nand has helped others gain a greater appreciation for sports\nas well. Judith Lanster was 17 when she starred in this film,\nand she was among those it influenced. Reflecting on the\nfilm, she said, 'As a rookie actress who went through her\nfair share of trial and error, I really related to Rachel, and I\nthink that's why—for the first time—I was able to deliver a\nflawless performance. It was that experience of becoming\nRachel that helped shape the person I am today.'\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Film Staff Writer)\n",
